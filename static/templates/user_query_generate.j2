Given the following function schemas:

<schema>
{{ schemas | indent(2) }}
</schema>

Generate {{ num_examples }} pairs of User Queries and Available Functions. Each pair should consist of a user query that may require the use of zero, one, or multiple functions from the provided schemas.

Adhere to the following guidelines:
1. User Queries should be realistic and diverse, covering various scenarios related to file and folder operations.
2. Available Functions should list all functions necessary to complete the task described in the User Query.
3. Some queries may not require any functions, some may require one, and others may require multiple functions.
4. Ensure that the Available Functions accurately match the needs of the User Query.
5. Use a mix of simple and complex queries that might require chaining multiple functions.
6. Available Functions should also contain 1-3 functions that is not required for the query to be completed.

Format your response as follows:

[
    {
        "user_query": "Detailed User Query 1",
        "available_functions": ["Relevant Function 1", "Relevant Function 2", "Unrelated Function 1", "Unrelated Function 2"]
    },
    {
        "user_query": "Complex User Query 2",
        "available_functions": ["Relevant Function 3", "Relevant Function 4", "Unrelated Function 3"]
    },
    {
        "user_query": "Simple User Query 3",
        "available_functions": []
    },
    ...
]
