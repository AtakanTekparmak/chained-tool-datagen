Given the following function schemas:

<schema>
{{ schemas | indent(2) }}
</schema>

Generate {{ num_examples }} pairs of User Queries and Required Functions. Each pair should consist of a user query that may require the use of zero, one, or multiple functions from the provided schemas.

Adhere to the following guidelines:
1. User Queries should be realistic and diverse, covering various scenarios related to file and folder operations.
2. Required Functions should list all functions necessary to complete the task described in the User Query.
3. Some queries may not require any functions, some may require one, and others may require multiple functions.
4. Ensure that the Required Functions accurately match the needs of the User Query.
5. Use a mix of simple and complex queries that might require chaining multiple functions.
6. Required functions should also contain 1-3 functions that is not required for the query to be completed.

Format your response as follows:

</examples>
[
    {
        "user_query": "User Query 1",
        "required_functions": ["Function 1", "Function 2", "Function 3"]
    },
    {
        "user_query": "User Query 2",
        "required_functions": ["Function 1", "Function 2"]
    },
    ...
]
</examples>
