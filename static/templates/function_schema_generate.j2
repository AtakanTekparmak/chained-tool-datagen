Given the following curriculum details:
Category: {{category}}
Subcategory: {{subcategory}}
Tasks:
{{tasks}}

Generate JSON schemas for functions that could be used to accomplish these tasks.
For each task, generate at least one function schema.
Each schema should include:
    - name: A descriptive name for the function
    - description: A brief description of what the function does
    - parameters: A dict of parameters the function accepts, including their names and types
    - required: A list of required parameter names
    - returns: A list of return values, including their names and types

Adhere to the following guidelines:
    - Provide the schemas in valid JSON format. Wrap each schema in <schema> and </schema> tags.
    - Separate each schema with a newline. 
    - Use snake_case for function names and variables.
    - Ensure that the function names are descriptive and relevant to the task.
    - When dealing with files, use file_path as the identifying parameter instead of file_name or file_id.
    - Include a diverse set of function schemas without repeating similar functions.
    - Do not include any additional information outside the JSON schemas in between the <schema> tags.
    - ALWAYS use double quotes for JSON keys and string values.

Following is an example response for the Category, Subcategory, and Task pair of "File System", "File", "Create a new File":
<schema>
{
    "name": "create_new_file",
    "description": "Creates a new file with the provided content at the specified file path.",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "file_path",
            "type": "str"
        },
        {
            "name": "content",
            "type": "str"
        }
    ],
    "required": ["file_path", "content"],
    "returns": [
        {
            "name": "success",
            "type": "bool"
        }
    ]
}
